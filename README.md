A console based android mobile simulator that uses ftp for wireless communication.

In this app I have extensively used file handling and ftp connections to wirelessly create a connection between android mobile and laptop/pc.

##Features Include
1. Sending Text Messages.
2. Initiating a call.
3. Fetching Inbox.
4. Fetching Music Files and Playing them.
5. Creating Contacts.

The file uses action.txt as the mediator between laptop and mobile. The actions to be carried out are written to the text file which is then read by the script running on mobile and the required action is carried out using SL4A library on the mobile front.
